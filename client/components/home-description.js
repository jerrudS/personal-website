        <p>Hi, Im Jerrud.  Im a Software Developer specializing in the Future (JavaScript of course).
          I recently completed a JavaScript bootcamp...whew, it was pretty tough but I managed to make it out alive!
          Coding wasn't always what I wanted to do with my life, so how did I get here, you ask?</p>
        <p>I have been an athlete all my life.  Well, I played baseball (I know some of you haters say baseball players aren't athletes pshh).
          Anyway, I played at Indiana University, and then went on to play 5 years professionally!  It was an amazing experience, and I was actually pretty good!
          After I retired from baseball, I started my search for a career that I would like, and also hopefully make some money in.  Finally, I stumbled upon coding.
          I found that since I liked solving problems, being challenged, and also enjoying math and physics, coding was an activity that I could have some fun with!</p>
        <p>Looking for the best way to learn how to be a software developer, I stumbled on Orange County Code School in Newport Beach, California.
          After some doubts, a lot of frustration and stress, some victories, and some new friends, I made it through the program!  I knew learning JavaScript was not going to be easy,
          but this program was a serious mental test that threw me through an infinite loop (pun intended!).</p>
        <p>I now look forward to developing my coding skills, and learning all I can to become a great software developer.  I believe I have a very good foundation,
          and I look forward to where I will be in a couple years!</p>
